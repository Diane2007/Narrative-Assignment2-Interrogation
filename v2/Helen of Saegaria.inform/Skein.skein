Helen of Saegaria
The lady in armor has her own secrets by Diane Wang
Release 1 / Serial number 231105 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D

Apartment
A shitty studio apartment, but it's a cozy kind of shitty--tiny but full of warmth, old but full of character. You like it because it's your apartment. 

The only thing that itches you about this place is that your cousin gave you a gun for Thanksgiving last year, which could be read as a kind gesture or the complete opposite, and that gun is sitting right in this room. You don't quite want to think about it, however, because the idea of a gun makes you nervous. 

It's a good thing you still have a place to return to after a day of dull work typing in numbers in an excel sheet. You're glad that you took accounting in college, because though it sucks, it now provides a roof over your head, food to fill your belly, and most importantly, a beefy computer that allows you to play the latest game, Assault on Saegaria.

Playing that game has been your routine, and you don't plan to break it tonight. 

You haven't launched the game yet.

You can see a fire extinguisher and a first aid kit here.

&gt;[1] play game
You launch the game.

But before you get to the point of continuing your most recent campaign, something in your computer flashes, blinding you with bright golden light. Then you realize you're not alone anymore. A woman crashes upon you.

And if she were slender a maiden in distress, all should have been well, but this gigantic monster of a lady is in full medieval armor when she lands on your head.

You could scream for help (and hope your obnoxious neighbor hears you), or you could fight. The gun your cousin gave you is sitting right there, by the way.

&gt;[2] scream
You scream because your head hurts like hell. Because Why the heck is this person in your room?

"My sincerest apologies, my lady," the woman quickly picks her up and bows her head. "Are you injured?"
[3] yes
"Just gimme a sec. My head just... ugh, hurts really bad," you groan. "And mind you, I am a man. And who are you, anyway?"

"Oh sweet goddess, where are my manners?" the woman bows again. "Helen of Saegaria, champion and personal knight to Her Royal Highness, Princess Josephine. It is a pleasure to make you acquaintance."

What in the-- You blink, and blink again. The princess' knight, the final boss you fought and died countless times, stands right in front of you.

But it is only polite that you also introduce yourself.

&gt;[4] introduce self
"Hi, my name is Dude," you say and offers Helen a hand to shake.

"Interesting name, Helen shakes your hand and says nothing more. However, you know she is only being polite.

"Erm, so, why are you here?" you ask. "I mean, you're the final boss in Assault on Saegaria. How did you get here?"

Helen's brows furrow, "What are you even talking about? Did I hit your head too hard?"

"No, but you are the most famous and infamous character in this game!

"A game?" Helen is clearly ruffled. "Are you declaring that my honor and my service to the crown is nothing but a game to you?"

Is there a way to tell her about the game, so she understands what you're talking about? Or you can just show her the game?

"Just look!" you turn the computer monitor to Helen's direction.

"What form of sorcery is this?" Helen jumps back, flashed and confused and alarmed by the animation.

"No! Look at that avatar! That is you!" you points and turns your face to the screen and-- No, the tile Helen is supposed to be standing on is empty, and you suddenly recall that is because she is right here with you.

But Helen stops, her eyes fixed on the NPC standing on the castle balcony. Princess Josephine looks out of the window, distressed and lonely.

"Josie must be wondering where I am..." You seem to hear her whisper.

"Josie?" you frown. That name doesn't ring a bell at all. Is it a new NPC in the next update that Helen is aware of (because hell, she is literally from that world)?

"No, I didn't say anything," Helen clears her throat, looking stern once again."

But the next second, another player appears behind Princess Josephine, and at the same moment, Helen disappears into the ether.

Is she back in the game?

&gt;[1] play game
You launch the game just in time when Helen jumps in and blocks that player's giant axe with her shield. Seeing her in action, now that you've known her personally, makes you feel different now.

You would've cheered whoever challenging the princess' personal knight in the past, considering you never managed to defeat Helen.

But Helen is clearly at disadvantage right now. You recognize the player's armors and equipment--the full set requires at least $3000 or some extremely good luck. And with those armors, Helen stands no chance. And eventually, Helen collapses into her own pool of blood.

"Josie," she whispers in desperation when the player snatches the princess.

And the next second, Helen reappears in your apartment, bloodied and barely alive.

Is something that you can help her with to stop the bleeding?

&gt;[2] take first aid
Taken.

&gt;[3] help helen with first aid
Miraculously, Helen's wounds start fading once the dressing touches her skin. Maybe it's a game NPC superpower or something.

"You gotta learn to pick your fight wisely," you tell her. "One look at that guy, you should've known you stood no chance. Pay-to-win has been a big issue with this game."

"But I can't let anyone hurt my Josie, especially when--"

Helen stops, realizing she has slipped, saying the princess' name even.

Maybe asking her about Josie would help you understand the situation and aid Helen better.

&gt;[4] ask her about princess
(Helen about Princess)
"Mind you, that is Her Royal Highness, Princess Josephine for you," she warns.

&gt;[5] ask her about her highness
(Helen about Royal-Highness)
"She is my princess, but she is my Josie, too," Helen lowers her gaze.

"May I ask about Josie?" you ask, carefully.

Helen sighs, "You saved me, so... you may."

&gt;[6] ask her about josie
(Helen about Josie)
"At first I thought I could just stay by her side forever, as a knight, even if she was to wed her betrothed. That would've been better than everything I could get" She pauses. "But then the war broke out. The enemy king wants Josie as his bride. And turns out it is only a game to you people."

"Do you have feelings for Josie?" you ask.

Helen, seemingly startled by the way you ask, shakes under your gaze. "I do," Helen says. "But she is the princess and heir to the throne, while I am only a lowly-born knight. And our gender..." Helen looks away. "Forgive me."

But now that you think about it: If players can pay to win, is there anything that can give Helen an absolutely edge in the medieval warfare? Can you give it to Helen?

"It supposedly puts out a fire."

"What does 'supposedly' mean?" Helen frowns.

"I never read the manual, so I don't know how to use it anyway. Let's just hope my apartment doesn't get burned down when I cook."

"This healing box will put every healer in my world to shame. I would believe it would be immensely helpful to our comrades," Helen nods.

Helen's eyes widen, "Are you saying that any laymen without any formal training could bring on massive destruction to hundreds with this blasphemous object?"

"Well, that's about right," you shrugs.

"And your cousin acquired this thing for you?"

"Well he just gave it to me without asking if I ever wanted a gun."

"I would advice you to dispose of this weapon lest it caused you regrets," Helen frowns. "And your cousin needs help, if he ever received any."


But it may really, really give her an edge in the game, and she wouldn't be killing real people anyway.

But minutes later, the developers take the game down and annouce a hot fix to the "latest issues" in the game.

You wonder if they will be able to take away Helen's gun anyway, because that thing never existed in their code but came from the real world. You will see, and maybe Helen could come back to your apartment, if she ever found herself and Josie in trouble again, and you two could figure out something else.

You launch the game.

But before you get to the point of continuing your most recent campaign, something in your computer flashes, blinding you with bright golden light. Then you realize you're not alone anymore. A woman crashes upon you.

And if she were slender a maiden in distress, all should have been well, but this gigantic monster of a lady is in full medieval armor when she lands on your head.

You could scream for help (and hope your obnoxious neighbor hears you), or you could fight. The gun your cousin gave you is sitting right there, by the way.

&gt;[2] fight
"What in the world is going on?! Why the fuck are you in my room?!" you curse and kick into the woman's abdomen.

But that proves to be a horrible idea because of the way she is covered by heavy armor from head to toe. Not only your head hurts, but your foot hurts, too.

For someone covered in so much weight, the woman is still faster than you, and she easily tackles you to the ground. Is there something nearby that you can fight her with?

&gt;[3] fight her with sword
(Helen with the sword)
You aren't going to punch some armor with your bare hands, are you? There is nothing in your inventory!

&gt;[7] fight her with fire extinguisher
(Helen with the fire extinguisher)
You slam the fire extinguisher into her metal chest plate, knocking her back a few steps. But just as the armor lady picks herself up, you notice the giant sword she carries, all curses are swallowed back down.

"I mean no harm, and hell, look at me! How in the heaven's name could I even harm you?" you gesticulate at your whole body, which is as skinny and frail as any other accountant's on Wall Street.

"All right. Say 'yield' and I shall back down. A knight must not attack an enemy who yields." the armor lady says with a frown. Her armor still immaculate without any scratches.

&gt;[8] yield
"I yield!" you pant and feel relieved when Helen instantly sheathes her sword. "And who are you, anyway?"

"I guess I haven't properly introduced myself," Helen says with a bow. "Helen of Saegaria, champion and personal knight to Her Royal Highness, Princess Josephine. It is a pleasure to make you acquaintance."

What in the-- You blink, and blink again. The princess' knight, the final boss you fought and died countless times, stands right in front of you.

But it is only polite that you also introduce yourself.

&gt;[9] introducing
"Hi, my name is Dude," you say and offers Helen a hand to shake.

"Interesting name, Helen shakes your hand and says nothing more. However, you know she is only being polite.

"Erm, so, why are you here?" you ask. "I mean, you're the final boss in Assault on Saegaria. How did you get here?"

"No, but you are the most famous and infamous character in this game!

Helen stops, realizing she has slipped.

"And your cousin acquired this thing for you?"

"Well he just gave it to me without asking if I ever wanted a gun."

Nervously, you reach out to the gun.

"You say this is a weapon, but I have never seen any... "players" from your world brandishing such a weapon in Saegaria," Helen says.

"I think the community is more into melee than anything else. You know, melee is for tough guys," you continue. "Do you want this, though? You could really protect Her Highness well with a gun. Nobody's armor could stop a bullet, I guess."

Helen gives it another cautious look, looks away, and sighs, "Fine. I think you do have a point."

Now give the gun to Helen, and you'll be rid of this bloody weapon at last.

Helen is unimpressed.

"Do you have feelings for Josie?" you ask.

Helen, seemingly startled by the way you ask, shakes under your gaze. "I do," Helen says. "But she is the princess and heir to the throne, while I am only a lowly-born knight. And our gender..." Helen looks away. "Forgive me."

But now that you think about it: If players can pay to win, is there anything that can give Helen an absolutely edge in the medieval warfare? Can you give it to Helen?

When the weapon touches her fingers, Helen disappears into the ether once more, and you know she is back in the game. How is she doing back in Saegaria, though? You could only find out if you play the game.

Helen of Saegaria
The lady in armor has her own secrets by Diane Wang
Release 1 / Serial number 231102 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D

Apartment
A shitty studio apartment, but it's a cozy kind of shitty--tiny but full of warmth, old but full of character. You like it because it's your apartment. 

The only thing that itches you about this place is that your cousin gave you a gun for Thanksgiving last year, which could be read as a kind gesture or the complete opposite, and that gun is sitting right in this room. You don't quite want to think about it, however, because the idea of a gun makes you nervous. 

It's a good thing you still have a place to return to after a day of dull work typing in numbers in an excel sheet. You're glad that you took accounting in college, because though it sucks, it now provides a roof over your head, food to fill your belly, and most importantly, a beefy computer that allows you to play the latest game, Assault on Saegaria.

Playing that game has been your routine, and you don't plan to break it tonight. 

The game is off.

You can see a fire extinguisher and a first aid kit here.

But before you get to the point of continuing your most recent campaign, something in your computer flashes, blinding you with bright golden light. Then you realize you're not alone anymore. A woman crashes upon you.

And if she were slender a maiden in distress, all should have been well, but this gigantic monster of a lady is in full medival armor when she lands on your head.

You could scream for help (and hope your obnoxious neighbor hears you), or you could fight. The gun your cousin gave you is sitting right there, by the way.

"Pardon me, but I do not understand what a "cosplay" is, nor do I know about "Ezzie". Is that perhaps the title of a lord? These armors belong to the royal family of Saegaria and the Order of the Knights of Sun."


She's either too into the whole cosplay thing, or she is totally nuts. You wonder about her identity.

You would've cheered whoever challenging the princess' personal knight in the past, considering you never managed to defeat Helen.

But Helen is clearly at disadvantage right now. You recognize the player's armors and equipment--the full set requires at least $3000 or some extremely good luck. And with those armors, Helen stands no chance. And eventually, Helen collapses into her own pool of blood.

"Josie," she whispers in desperation when the player snatches the princess.

And the next second, Helen reappears in your apartment, bloodied and barely alive.

Is something that you can help her with to stop the bleeding?

"Just look!" you turn the computer monitor to Helen's direction.

"What form of sorcery is this?" Helen jumps back, flashed and confused and alarmed by the animation.

"No! Look at that avatar! That is you!" you points and turns your face to the screen and-- No, the tile Helen is supposed to be standing on is empty, and you suddenly recall that is because she is right here with you.

But Helen stops, her eyes fixed on the NPC standing on the castle balcony. Princess Josephine looks out of the window, distressed and lonely.

"Josie must be wondering where I am..." You seem to hear her whisper.

"Josie?" you frown. That name doesn't ring a bell at all. Is it a new NPC in the next update that Helen is aware of (because hell, she is literally from that world)?

"No, I didn't say anything," Helen clears her throat, looking stern once again."

But the next second, another player appears behind Princess Josephine, and at the same moment, Helen disappears into the ether. Is she back in the game? You need to play and see what is going on.

(first taking the Assault on Saegaria)
That's fixed in place.

"A game?" Helen is clearly ruffled. "Are you declaring that my honor and my service to the crown is nothing but a game to you?"

&gt;[1] tell her about game
(Helen about the Assault on Saegaria)
Helen stares at you, "What you just told me might be the most ludicrous thing I have ever been told."

Maybe the only way to convince Helen is to show her the game.

&gt;[2] show her the game
(to Helen)
"Just look!" you turn the computer monitor to Helen's direction.

"What form of sorcery is this?" Helen jumps back, flashed and confused and alarmed by the animation.

"No! Look at that avatar! That is you!" you points and turns your face to the screen and-- No, the tile Helen is supposed to be standing on is empty, and you suddenly recall that is because she is right here with you.

But Helen stops, her eyes fixed on the NPC standing on the castle balcony. Princess Josephine looks out of the window, distressed and lonely.

"Josie must be wondering where I am..." You seem to hear her whisper.

"Josie?" you frown. That name doesn't ring a bell at all. Is it a new NPC in the next update that Helen is aware of (because hell, she is literally from that world)?

"No, I didn't say anything," Helen clears her throat, looking stern once again."

But the next second, another player appears behind Princess Josephine, and at the same moment, Helen disappears into the ether.

Is she back in the game?

(Helen with the gun)
You are't carrying the gun!

&gt;[7] fight her with fire extinguisher
(Helen with the fire extinguisher)
You slam the fire extinguisher into her metal chest plate, knocking her back a few steps. But just as the armor lady picks herself up, you notice the giant sword she carries, all curses are swallowed back down.

"I mean no harm, and hell, look at me! How in the heaven's name could I even harm you?" you gesticulate at your whole body, which is as skinny and frail as any other accountant's on Wall Street.

"All right. Say 'yield' and I shall back down. A knight must not attack an enemy who yields." the armor lady says with a frown. Her armor still immaculate without any scratches.

&gt;[8] yield
"I yield!" you pant and feel relieved when Helen instantly sheathes her sword. "And who are you, anyway?"

"I guess I haven't properly introduced myself," Helen says with a bow. "Helen of Saegaria, champion and personal knight to Her Royal Highness, Princess Josephine. It is a pleasure to make you acquaintance."

What in the-- You blink, and blink again. The princess' knight, the final boss you fought and died countless times, stands right in front of you.

But it is only polite that you also introduce yourself.

&gt;[9] introducing
"Hi, my name is Dude," you say and offers Helen a hand to shake.

"Interesting name, Helen shakes your hand and says nothing more. However, you know she is only being polite.

"Erm, so, why are you here?" you ask. "I mean, you're the final boss in Assault on Saegaria. How did you get here?"

Helen's brows furrow, "What are you even talking about? Did I hit your head too hard?"

"No, but you are the most famous and infamous character in this game!

"A game?" Helen is clearly ruffled. "Are you declaring that my honor and my service to the crown is nothing but a game to you?"

Is there a way to tell her about the game, so she understands what you're talking about? Or you can just show her the game?

"You gotta learn to pick your fight wisely," you tell her. "One look at that guy, you should've known you stood no chance. Pay-to-win has been a big issue with this game."

"But I can't let anyone hurt my princess. At first I just thought it was her betrothed causing trouble at the border that caused the invasion, but now..." Helen sighs. "I can't understand why you people found killing us fun, taking Josie like a-."

"Who are you? Why are you in my room?" You grumble.

"Oh sweet goddess, where are my manners?" the woman bows again. "Helen of Saegaria, champion and personal knight to Her Royal Highness, Princess Josephine. It is a pleasure to make you acquaintance."

What in the-- You blink, and blink again. The princess' knight, the final boss you fought and died countless times, stands right in front of you.

&gt;[1] tell her about game
(Helen about the Assault on Saegaria)
Helen stares at you, "What you just told me might be the most ludicrous thing I have ever been told."

Maybe the only way to convince Helen is to show her the game.

&gt;[2] show her the game
(to Helen)
"Just look!" you turn the computer monitor to Helen's direction.

"What form of sorcery is this?" Helen jumps back, flashed and confused and alarmed by the animation.

"No! Look at that avatar! That is you!" you points and turns your face to the screen and-- No, the tile Helen is supposed to be standing on is empty, and you suddenly recall that is because she is right here with you.

But Helen stops, her eyes fixed on the NPC standing on the castle balcony. Princess Josephine looks out of the window, distressed and lonely.

"Josie must be wondering where I am..." You seem to hear her whisper.

"Josie?" you frown. That name doesn't ring a bell at all. Is it a new NPC in the next update that Helen is aware of (because hell, she is literally from that world)?

"No, I didn't say anything," Helen clears her throat, looking stern once again."

But the next second, another player appears behind Princess Josephine, and at the same moment, Helen disappears into the ether.

Is she back in the game?

&gt;[1] play game
You launch the game just in time when Helen jumps in and blocks that player's giant axe with her shield. Seeing her in action, now that you've known her personally, makes you feel different now.

You would've cheered whoever challenging the princess' personal knight in the past, considering you never managed to defeat Helen.

But Helen is clearly at disadvantage right now. You recognize the player's armors and equipment--the full set requires at least $3000 or some extremely good luck. And with those armors, Helen stands no chance. And eventually, Helen collapses into her own pool of blood.

"Josie," she whispers in desperation when the player snatches the princess.

And the next second, Helen reappears in your apartment, bloodied and barely alive.

Is something that you can help her with to stop the bleeding?

&gt;[2] take first aid
Taken.

&gt;[3] help helen with first aid
Miraculously, Helen's wounds start fading once the dressing touches her skin. Maybe it's a game NPC superpower or something.

"You gotta learn to pick your fight wisely," you tell her. "One look at that guy, you should've known you stood no chance. Pay-to-win has been a big issue with this game."

"But I can't let anyone hurt my Josie, especially when--"

Helen stops, realizing she has slipped, saying the princess' name even.

Maybe asking her about Josie would help you understand the situation and aid Helen better.

&gt;[4] ask her about princess
(Helen about Princess)
"Mind you, that is Her Royal Highness, Princess Josephine for you," she warns.

&gt;[5] ask her about her highness
(Helen about Royal-Highness)
"She is my princess, but she is my Josie, too," Helen lowers her gaze.

"May I ask about Josie?" you ask, carefully.

Helen sighs, "You saved me, so... you may."

&gt;[6] ask her about josie
(Helen about Josie)
"At first I thought I could just stay by her side forever, as a knight, even if she was to wed her betrothed. That would've been better than everything I could get" She pauses. "But then the war broke out. The enemy king wants Josie as his bride. And turns out it is only a game to you people."

"Do you have feelings for Josie?" you ask.

Helen, seemingly startled by the way you ask, shakes under your gaze. "I do," Helen says. "But she is the princess and heir to the throne, while I am only a lowly-born knight. And our gender..." Helen looks away. "Forgive me."

But now that you think about it: If players can pay to win, is there anything that can give Helen an absolutely edge in the medieval warfare? Can you give it to Helen?

But minutes later, the developers take the game down and annouce a hot fix to the "latest issues" in the game.

You wonder if they will be able to take away Helen's gun anyway, because that thing never existed in their code but came from the real world. You will see, and maybe Helen could come back to your apartment, if she ever found herself and Josie in trouble again, and you two could figure out something else.

For someone covered in so much weight, the woman is still faster than you, and she easily tackles you to the ground. Is there something nearby that you can fight her with?

"What is this object? A mallet, perhaps?" Helen asks.

"It supposedly puts out a fire."

"What does 'supposedly' mean?" Helen frowns.

"I never read the manual, so I don't know how to use it anyway. Let's just hope my apartment doesn't get burned down when I cook."

Helen gives you a look that says "Please get your life together."

"What in the world is going on?! Why the fuck are you in my room?!" you curse and kick into the woman's abdomen.

But that proves to be a horrible idea because of the way she is covered by heavy armor from head to toe. Not only your head hurts, but your foot hurts, too.

For someone covered in so much weight, the woman is still faster than you, and she easily tackles you to the ground. Is there something nearby that you can fight her with?

&gt;[3] fight her with sword
(Helen with the sword)
You aren't going to punch some armor with your bare hands, are you? There is nothing in your inventory!

&gt;[4] fight her with fire extinguisher
(Helen with the fire extinguisher)

Taken.

&gt;[6] fight her with gun
(Helen with the gun)
You are't carrying the gun!

&gt;[7] fight her with fire extinguisher
(Helen with the fire extinguisher)
You slam the fire extinguisher into her metal chest plate, knocking her back a few steps. But just as the armor lady picks herself up, you notice the giant sword she carries, all curses are swallowed back down.

"I mean no harm, and hell, look at me! How in the heaven's name could I even harm you?" you gesticulate at your whole body, which is as skinny and frail as any other accountant's on Wall Street.

"All right. Say 'yield' and I shall back down. A knight must not attack an enemy who yields." the armor lady says with a frown. Her armor still immaculate without any scratches.

&gt;[8] yield
"I yield!" you pant and feel relieved when Helen instantly sheathes her sword. "And who are you, anyway?"

"I guess I haven't properly introduced myself," Helen says with a bow. "Helen of Saegaria, champion and personal knight to Her Royal Highness, Princess Josephine. It is a pleasure to make you acquaintance."

What in the-- You blink, and blink again. The princess' knight, the final boss you fought and died countless times, stands right in front of you.

But it is only polite that you also introduce yourself.

&gt;[9] introducing
"Hi, my name is Dude," you say and offers Helen a hand to shake.

"Interesting name, Helen shakes your hand and says nothing more. However, you know she is only being polite.

"Erm, so, why are you here?" you ask. "I mean, you're the final boss in Assault on Saegaria. How did you get here?"

Helen's brows furrow, "What are you even talking about? Did I hit your head too hard?"

"No, but you are the most famous and infamous character in this game!

"A game?" Helen is clearly ruffled. "Are you declaring that my honor and my service to the crown is nothing but a game to you?"

Is there a way to tell her about the game, so she understands what you're talking about? Or you can just show her the game?

(to Helen)
"Just look!" you turn the computer monitor to Helen's direction.

"What form of sorcery is this?" Helen jumps back, flashed and confused and alarmed by the animation.

"No! Look at that avatar! That is you!" you points and turns your face to the screen and-- No, the tile Helen is supposed to be standing on is empty, and you suddenly recall that is because she is right here with you.

But Helen stops, her eyes fixed on the NPC standing on the castle balcony. Princess Josephine looks out of the window, distressed and lonely.

"Josie must be wondering where I am..." You seem to hear her whisper.

"Josie?" you frown. That name doesn't ring a bell at all. Is it a new NPC in the next update that Helen is aware of (because hell, she is literally from that world)?

"No, I didn't say anything," Helen clears her throat, looking stern once again."

But the next second, another player appears behind Princess Josephine, and at the same moment, Helen disappears into the ether.

"It supposedly puts out a fire."

"What does 'supposedly' mean?" Helen frowns.

"I never read the manual, so I don't know how to use it anyway. Let's just hope my apartment doesn't get burned down when I cook."

You slam the fire extinguisher into her metal chest plate, knocking her back a few steps. But just as the armor lady picks herself up, you notice the giant sword she carries, all curses are swallowed back down.

"I mean no harm, and hell, look at me! How in the heaven's name could I even harm you?" you gesticulate at your whole body, which is as skinny and frail as any other accountant's on Wall Street.

"All right. Say 'yield' and I shall back down. A knight must not attack an enemy who yields." the armor lady says with a frown. Her armor still immaculate without any scratches.

"Interesting name, Helen shakes your hand and says nothing more. However, you know she is only being polite.

Helen's brows furrow, "What are you even talking about? Did I hit your head too hard?"

"No, but you are the most famous and infamous character in this game!

"A game?" Helen is clearly ruffled. "Are you declaring that my honor and my service to the crown is nothing but a game to you?"

Is there a way to tell her about the game, so she understands what you're talking about? Or you can just show her the game?

Helen stares at you, "What you just told me might be the most ludicrous thing I have ever been told."

Maybe the only way to convince Helen is to show her the game.

&gt;[2] show her the game
(to Helen)
"Just look!" you turn the computer monitor to Helen's direction.

"What form of sorcery is this?" Helen jumps back, flashed and confused and alarmed by the animation.

"No! Look at that avatar! That is you!" you points and turns your face to the screen and-- No, the tile Helen is supposed to be standing on is empty, and you suddenly recall that is because she is right here with you.

But Helen stops, her eyes fixed on the NPC standing on the castle balcony. Princess Josephine looks out of the window, distressed and lonely.

"Josie must be wondering where I am..." You seem to hear her whisper.

"Josie?" you frown. That name doesn't ring a bell at all. Is it a new NPC in the next update that Helen is aware of (because hell, she is literally from that world)?

"No, I didn't say anything," Helen clears her throat, looking stern once again."

But the next second, another player appears behind Princess Josephine, and at the same moment, Helen disappears into the ether.

Is she back in the game?

But Helen is clearly at disadvantage right now. You recognize the player's armors and equipment--the full set requires at least $3000 or some extremely good luck. And with those armors, Helen stands no chance. And eventually, Helen collapses into her own pool of blood.

"Josie," she whispers in desperation when the player snatches the princess.

And the next second, Helen reappears in your apartment, bloodied and barely alive.

Is something that you can help her with the bleeding?

"What is this object? A mallet, perhaps?" Helen asks.

"It supposedly puts out a fire."

"What does 'supposedly' mean?" Helen frowns.

"I never read the manual, so I don't know how to use it anyway. Let's just hope my apartment doesn't get burned down when I cook."

You slam the fire extinguisher into her metal chest plate, knocking her back a few steps. But just as the armor lady picks herself up, you notice the giant sword she carries, all curses are swallowed back down.

"I mean no harm, and hell, look at me! How in the heaven's name could I even harm you?" you gesticulate at your whole body, which is as skinny and frail as any other accountant's on Wall Street.

"All right. Say 'yield' and I shall back down. A knight must not attack an enemy who yields." the armor lady says with a frown. Her armor still immaculate without any scratches.

"Interesting name, Helen shakes your hand and says nothing more. However, you know she is only being polite.

"Erm, so, why are you here?" you ask. "I mean, you're the final boss in Assault on Saegaria. How did you get here?"

Helen's brows furrow, "What are you even talking about? Did I hit your head too hard?"

"No, but you are the most famous and infamous character in this game!

"A game?" Helen is clearly ruffled. "Are you declaring that my honor and my service to the crown is nothing but a game to you?"

Is there a way to tell her about the game, so she understands what you're talking about? Or you can just show her the game?

"Josie must be wondering where I am..." You seem to hear her whisper.

"Josie?" you frown. That name doesn't ring a bell at all. Is it a new NPC in the next update that Helen is aware of (because hell, she is literally from that world)?

"No, I didn't say anything," Helen clears her throat, looking stern once again."

But the next second, another player appears behind Princess Josephine, and at the same moment, Helen disappears into the ether. Is she back in the game? You need to play and see what is going on.

You would've cheered whoever challenging the princess' personal knight in the past, considering you never managed to defeat Helen.

But Helen is clearly at disadvantage right now. You recognize the player's armors and equipment--the full set requires at least $3000 or some extremely good luck. And with those armors, Helen stands no chance. And eventually, Helen collapses into her own pool of blood.

"Josie," she whispers in desperation when the player snatches the princess.

And the next second, Helen reappears in your apartment, bloodied and barely alive.

Is something that you can help her with the bleeding?

You slam the fire extinguisher into her metal chest plate, knocking her back a few steps. But just as the armor lady picks herself up, you notice the giant sword she carries, all curses are swallowed back down.

"I mean no harm, and hell, look at me! How in the heaven's name could I even harm you?" you gesticulate at your whole body, which is as skinny and frail as any other accountant's on Wall Street.

"All right. Say 'yield' and I shall back down. A knight must not attack an enemy who yields." the armor lady says with a frown. Her armor still immaculate without any scratches.
