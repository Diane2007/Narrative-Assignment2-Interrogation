Helen of Saegaria
An Interactive Fiction by Diane Wang
Release 1 / Serial number 231026 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D

Apartment
A shitty studio apartment, but it's a cozy kind of shitty--tiny but full of warmth, old but full of character. You like it because it's your apartment. 

It's a good thing you still have a place to return to after a day of dull work typing in numbers in an excel sheet. You're glad that you took accounting in college, because though it sucks, it now provides a roof over your head, food to fill your belly, and most importantly, a beefy laptop that allows you to play the latest game, Assault on Saegaria.

Playing that game has been your routine, and you don't plan to break it tonight. 

You haven't launched the game yet.

You can see a fire extinguisher here.

&gt;[1] launch game
You launch the game.

But before you get to the point of continuing your most recent campaign, something in your computer flashes, blinding you with bright golden light. Then you realize you're not alone anymore. A woman crashes upon you.

And if she were slender a maiden in distress, all should have been well, but this gigantic monster of a lady is in full Medival armor when she lands on your head.

You are about to scream in pain. You are about to curse because what in the holy macaroni is going on?

&gt;[2] scream
You scream because your head hurts like hell. Because Why the heck is this person in your room?

"My sincerest apologies, my lady," the woman quickly picks her up and bows her head. "Are you injured?"
[3] yes
"Just gimme a sec. My head just... ugh, hurts really bad," you groan. "And mind you, I am a man.

Helen frowns, sizing you up, "A man? Huh." If she's trying to stay polite you don't know, but the questioning in her look is pretty obvious to you.

What the heck does that mean? You are about to protest, but the moment you notices the giant sword she carries, all curses are swallowed back down. Hell, you'd pretty much like your head to stay on your shoulders.

&gt;[4] x sword
The sword, though perfectly sheathed into the golden, well, sheath, proudly displays a family crest that you are too familiar with. The crest of House Saegaria, the very royal family in Assault on Saegaria that you are trying to defeat.

&gt;[5] x armor
Somehow, you think you've seen this armor before. 

Shiny, silver, with the shinest possible metal--the kind of expensive stuff that no one should be able to afford--modern cosplayers and real medieval soldiers alike.

You can't help but wonder about this woman's identity. But unless her dad is Elon Musk and bought her this ridiculous set of armor, you can't think of another explanation.

&gt;[6] think about sword
Is it even legal to carry a sword around in New York?

&gt;[7] think about armor
Back in the old days, only nobles could afford such an expensive set of armors. But nobles wouldn't let their daughters fight at all... And if somebody went all the way to purchase such a flashy set of armors just for cosplay, that is seriously impressive. Maybe you should ask Helen about the armors.

&gt;[8] ask about sword
(addressing Helen)
"Why are you even carrying a sword?" you ask, still fearing for your head.

Helen gives you the look like you're stupid, "Because I am a knight, and I am not taking off the sword my lady bestowed me when I was knighted."


Maybe this woman is an actress because that is so method.

&gt;[9] ask about armor
"Did you just get out of a cosplay event? That is some impressive armor. Did you get them from Etsy?" you tell her. If there is one in town right now, you definitely are going.

"Pardon me, but I do not understand what a "cosplay" is, nor do I know about "Ezzie". Is that perhaps the title of a lord? These armors belong to the royal family of Saegaria and the Order of the Knights of Sun."

She's either too into the whole game, or she is nuts.

&gt;[10] wonder about identity
Simply wondering about this woman's identity is no use. Maybe just ask her.

&gt;[11] ask about identity
"Who are you? Why are you in my room?" You grumble.

"Oh sweet goddess, where are my manners?" the woman bows again. "Helen of Saegaria, champion and personal knight to Her Royal Highness, Princess Josephine. It is a pleasure to make you acquaintance."

What in the-- You blink, and blink again. The princess' knight, your future final boss, is a woman.

"What in the fuck is going on?! Why the fuck are you in my room?!" you curse and kick into the woman's abdomen.

But that proves to be a horrible idea because of the way she is covered by heavy armor from head to toe. Not only your head hurts, but your foot hurts, too.

For someone covered in so much weight, the woman is still faster than you, and she easily tackles you to the ground. You think you're getting killed, but is there something in the room that is also made of metal? Maybe you can fight her with it?

&gt;[3] fight her with pc
(Helen with the PC)
You aren't going to punch some armor with your bare hands, are you? There is nothing in your inventory!

&gt;[4] take fire extinguisher
Taken.

&gt;[5] fight her with fire extinguisher
(Helen with the fire extinguisher)
You slam the fire extinguisher into her metal chest plate, knocking her back a few steps. But just as the armor lady picks herself up, you notice the giant sword she carries, all curses are swallowed back down.

"I mean no harm, and hell, look at me! How in the heaven's name could I even harm you?" you gesticulate at your whole body, which is as skinny and frail as any other accountant's on Wall Street.

"All right. I may not attack an enemy who yields." the armor lady says with a frown. Her armor still immaculate without any scratches.

&gt;[6] ask about sword
(addressing Helen)
There is no reply.

&gt;[7] ask about armor
There is no reply.

&gt;[8] ask about identity
"Who are you? Why are you in my room?" You grumble.

"Oh sweet goddess, where are my manners?" the woman bows again. "Helen of Saegaria, champion and personal knight to Her Royal Highness, Princess Josephine. It is a pleasure to make you acquaintance."

What in the-- You blink, and blink again. The princess' knight, your future final boss, is a woman.

But how did she get here?

&gt;[9] ask helen about why she is here
To be continued.

Helen of Saegaria
An Interactive Fiction by Diane Wang
Release 1 / Serial number 231025 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D

Apartment
A shitty studio apartment, but it's a cozy kind of shitty--tiny but full of warmth, old but full of character. You like it because it's your apartment. 

It's a good thing you still have a place to return to after a day of dull work typing in numbers in an excel sheet. You're glad that you took accounting in college, because though it sucks, it now provides a roof over your head, food to fill your belly, and most importantly, a beefy laptop that allows you to play the latest game, Assault on Saegaria.

Playing that game has been your routine, and you don't plan to break it tonight. 

You can see a fire extinguisher here.

&gt;[1] launch game
You launch the game.

But before you get to the point of continuing your most recent campaign, something in your computer flashes, blinding you with bright golden light. Then you realize you're not alone anymore. A woman crashes upon you.

And if she were slender a maiden in distress, all should have been well, but this gigantic monster of a lady is in full Medival armor when she lands on your head.

You are about to scream in pain. You are about to fight or flight because this is New York City, and having a stranger appearing in your place out of a sudden is a bad sign.

&gt;[2] scream
You scream because your head hurts like hell. Because Why the heck is this person in your room?

"My sincerest apologies, my lady," the woman quickly picks her up and bows her head. "Are you injured?"
[3] yes
"Just gimme a sec. My head just... ugh, hurts really bad," you groan. "And mind you, I am a man.

Helen frowns, sizing you up, "A man? Huh." If she's trying to stay polite you don't know, but the questioning in her look is pretty obvious to you.

What the heck does that mean? You are about to protest, but the moment you notice the giant sword she carries, all curses are swallowed back down. Hell, you'd pretty much like your head to stay on your shoulders.

&gt;[4] x sword
The sword, though perfectly sheathed into the golden, well, sheath, proudly displays a family crest that you are too familiar with. The crest of House Saegaria, the very royal family in Assault on Saegaria that you are trying to defeat.

&gt;[5] x armor
Somehow, you think you've seen this armor before. 

Shiny, silver, with the shinest possible metal--the kind of expensive stuff that no one should be able to afford--modern cosplayers and real medieval soldiers alike.

You can't help but wonder about this woman's identity. But unless her dad is Elon Musk and bought her this ridiculous set of armor, you can't think of another explanation.

&gt;[6] think about sword
Is it even legal to carry a sword around in New York?

&gt;[7] think about armor
Back in the old days, only nobles could afford such an expensive set of armors. But nobles wouldn't let their daughters fight at all... And if somebody went all the way to purchase such a flashy set of armors just for cosplay, that is seriously impressive. Maybe you should ask Helen about the armors.

&gt;[8] ask about sword
[(addressing Helen) - type "response 1" for details]
"Why are you even carrying a sword?" you ask, still fearing for your head.

Helen gives you the look like you're stupid, "Because I am a knight, and I am not taking off the sword my lady bestowed me when I was knighted."

Maybe this woman is an actress because that is so method.

&gt;[9] ask about armor
"Did you just get out of a cosplay event? That is some impressive armor. Did you get them from Etsy?" you tell her. If there is one in town right now, you definitely are going.

"Pardon me, but I do not understand what a "cosplay" is, nor do I know about "Ezzie". Is that perhaps the title of a lord? These armors belong to the royal family of Saegaria and the Order of the Knights of Sun."

She's either too into the whole game, or she is nuts.

&gt;[10] wonder about identity
Simply wondering about this woman's identity is no use. Maybe just ask her.

&gt;[11] ask about identity
"Who are you? Why are you in my room?" You grumble.

"Oh sweet goddess, where are my manners?" the woman bows again. "Helen of Saegaria, champion and personal knight to Her Royal Highness, Princess Josephine. It is a pleasure to make you acquaintance."

What in the-- You blink, and blink again. The princess' knight, your future final boss, is a woman.

But how did she get here?

"Why are you even carrying a sword?" you ask, still fearing for your head.

Helen gives you the look like you're stupid, "Because I am a knight, and I am not taking off the sword my lady bestowed me when I was knighted."

Maybe this woman is an actress because that is so method.

"Did you just get out of a cosplay event? That is some impressive armor. Did you get them from Etsy?" you tell her. If there is one in town right now, you definitely are going.

"Pardon me, but I do not understand what a "cosplay" is, nor do I know about "Ezzie". Is that perhaps the title of a lord? These armors belong to the royal family of Saegaria and the Order of the Knights of Sun."

She's either too into the whole game, or she is nuts.

But that proves to be a horrible idea because of the way she is covered by heavy armor from head to toe. Not only your head hurts, but your foot hurts, too.

For someone covered in so much weight, the woman is still faster than you, and she easily tackles you to the ground. You think you're getting killed, but is there something in the room that is also made of metal? Maybe you can fight her with it?

"Why are you even carrying a sword?" you ask, still fearing for your head.

Helen gives you the look like you're stupid, "Because I am a knight, and I am not taking off the sword my lady bestowed me when I was knighted."

Maybe this woman is an actress because that is so method.

Since you know nothing about medieval stuff and have absolutely no clue what to ask about, maybe examine that thing first just to avoid sounding like an idiot?

Helen frowns, sizing you up, "A man? Huh." If she's trying to stay polite you don't know, but the questioning in her look is pretty obvious to you.

What the heck does that mean? You are about to protest, but the moment you notice the giant sword she carries, all curses are swallowed back down. Hell, you'd pretty much like your head to stay on your shoulders.

&gt;[1] launch game
You launch the game.

But before you get to the point of continuing your most recent campaign, something in your computer flashes, blinding you with bright golden light. Then you realize you're not alone anymore. A woman crashes upon you.

And if she were slender a maiden in distress, all should have been well, but this gigantic monster of a lady is in full Medival armor when she lands on your head.

You are about to scream in pain. You are about to fight or flight because this is New York City, and having a stranger appearing in your place out of a sudden is a bad sign.

&gt;[2] fight woman
Violence isn't the answer to this one.

&gt;[3] fight her with pc
(Helen with the PC)
You aren't going to punch some armor with your bare hands, are you?

&gt;[4] fight her with fire extinguisher

        <result xml:space="preserve">"What in the fuck is going on?! Why the fuck are you in my room?!" you curse and kick into the woman's abdomen.

But that proves to be a horrible idea because of the way she is covered by heavy armor from head to toe. Not only your head hurts, but your foot hurts, too.

For someone covered in so much weight, the woman is still faster than you, and she easily tackles you to the ground. You think you're getting killed, but is there something in the room that is also made of metal? Maybe you can fight her with it?
